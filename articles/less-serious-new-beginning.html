    <h2>A Less Serious New Beginning</h2>

      <p>Certain people are inclined to be more serious than others - this is the category I fall into, for now. Some
        may have a light hearted upbringing where creative expression and ease is valued over rigidity; in this, a more
        peaceful approach to life will likely be formed. While others may be constantly warned of dangers or criticized
        to perform better; in this, a fearful approach to life or underlying sense of inadequacy may be formed. My life
        has been closer to the latter. </p>
      <div class="full-width-text">
        <p>Ever since I was a young child, I have had a lot on my plate. Multiple parental divorces, cross-country
          moves, health challenges, and an overpowering addiction to video games which made me numb to all of these
          experiences. At the age of seventeen I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease, which seemed to make a lot of sense
          with my health challenges. I was lost and confused, and in a way still am.</p>
        <p>With the more recent realization of how much control I have over my life, I have prioritized taking care of
          my health and wellbeing. I have formed fairly rigid habits and beliefs in order to keep myself healthy and
          happy. Although this approach has been extremely beneficial towards my health, there has been somewhat of a
          downside. I adopted behaviors of taking everything very seriously. What I mean is, I take things seriously.</p>
        <p>Well, this is where it all changes. Recently, I have been working on taking life a little less seriously.
          Spontaneity has always been something I have desired. So, last week I went on a day trip to San Fransisco
          with a friend on an hours notice, something I would have likely convinced myself out of doing due to
          logistics and fear. For over three years, I have yearned to move out of Reno. I have never pulled the
          trigger, again due to logistics and fear. So, last week I decided I’m relocating to Phoenix, Arizona. And,
          yes… I know it’s hot there!</p>
        <p>We all have a huge amount of choice and influence in every moment of our lives to shape who we are, where we
          are, what we do, and who we spend time with. This is the true beauty of life. Of course, some stress can
          develop around this responsibility. But the truth is, if we fail, we can always try something new or move
          somewhere else. The consequences of our actions are almost never as severe as we think they will be. Although
          it doesn’t always and won’t always go smoothly, our experiences make us who we are. These experiences open
          new doors - offering us more choice to grow as individuals, to gain access to new opportunities, and to take
          life a little less seriously.</p>
        <p>So, in all not-so-seriousness. What changes have you been entertaining but haven’t been acting on? If you
          have wanted to make changes but haven’t, why haven’t you?</p>
        <p>Perhaps if you haven’t made these changes, you are taking life a little too seriously. I know I have been.</p>
