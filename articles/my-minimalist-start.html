      <p>Less is more. Quality over quantity. Over the years I had heard these words without caring about the message
        behind them. I often find myself thinking that clichés are useless and meaningless, but in these clichés I have
        now found meaning and reason.</p>
      <p>I recently started reading the author, Joshua Fields Millburn, a minimalist enthusiast. One thing that stood
        out was his quotation, “I wasn’t a minimalist, until I was.” I was intrigued by its profound simplicity. Twelve
        weeks ago the same thing happened to me. I became a minimalist so quickly I hardly had time to process it.
        Until now.</p>
      <div class="full-width-text">
        <p>In June I moved into a 380 square foot studio, from a 1-bedroom apartment, double in size. Without even
          realizing it, this was the moment I became a minimalist. The difference in square footage didn’t seem like
          much at the time. Imagine my surprise when nothing but my bed, small couch, and a later purchased small desk
          fit into my new apartment.</p>
        <p>As I unpacked my stuff over the next few days, I made a hoarder-like mound of surplus furniture. This
          mountain of furniture contained a dining room table with two chairs, LARGE desk, 53’ TV, TV stand, club
          reading chair, coffee table, bed frame, dresser, two living room side tables, and two bedside tables. Regret
          set in instantly as I realized not all of my possessions would fit. I had been optimistic when I signed the
          lease. Reality settled in, and I had no idea what I was going to do with my stuff…</p>
        <p>I neither had, nor wanted, to spend the money to store furniture. I did the most obvious thing I could think
          of to solve my problem. <i>I sold my shit on craigslist.</i></p>
        <p>I took pictures of things I knew would be quick sellers and put them up for a reasonable price. Things like
          the TV, coffee table, and dresser (for whatever reason) sold within the day. At the same time, I called my
          friends and asked if they needed any of the things from my pile and dropped off a few items. When things
          didn’t sell within a few days, I lowered the prices until they were irresistible. This helped eliminate some
          clutter, but I was still left with quite a lot. After a week, if something didn’t sell I moved it to the free
          section. It was incredible how quickly people responded to free items on craigslist… It didn’t even seem to
          matter what the item was. I posted an ad, turned around, walked seven feet to my bathroom (yes, I measured),
          and before I even made it into the bathroom I had four text messages asking if items were still available.
          Talk about an easy solution to my problem. The “buyer” even picked the items up from outside my apartment.</p>
        <p>I was never particularly attached to my possessions, which is a big part of the minimalism philosophy. I’d
          long known that if my apartment were broken into or burned down while I was away, I wouldn’t really care. I
          often didn’t even lock my door when I left. It wasn’t that I actually didn’t care if my things were stolen or
          incinerated; I just knew my things were replaceable. <i>A little part of me knew (despite being told
            otherwise) that possessions don’t define me.</i> I am not my nice furniture. I am not my big ass TV. I am
          not my dusty DVD collection.</p>
        <p>Even though I knew this to be true, there was still resistance and fear in the process of getting rid of my
          stuff. The thought of no longer having all the things I had acquired over time (especially my TV!) was
          terrifying. What if I need it? What if I miss it? What would life be like with no TV?!</p>
        <p>This move changed my life in more ways than I can fathom, and it’s still just the beginning.</p>
        <p>I wasn’t looking for rapid change when I decided to move into a smaller place. All I thought I was getting
          out of the move was cheaper rent. Instead, I got a catalyst for change in my way of living. It couldn’t have
          come at a better time.</p>
        <p>My situation was fairly drastic, yours doesn’t have to be. Start small. Donate some old clothes, books, VHS
          tapes, or 8-track tapes. Clean out the kitchen pantry and fridge of expired or undesirable items. Pick some
          items to put in a box. Put the box in the garage or out of the way for a month. Then, see if you really need
          or miss these items. Small steps can be profound in freeing up space in your home and in your mind.</p>
        <p>Minimalism isn’t just about having less in your life. It’s about making sure the things you do have are
          adding value. This includes material possessions, friendships, habits, thought patterns, and more.</p>
        <p>Sound easy? It is. Sound hard? Absolutely, it is. Rewarding? Definitely and without a doubt.</p>
