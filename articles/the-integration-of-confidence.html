    <h2>The Integration of Confidence</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="article-content">

      <p>Growing up, many of us have insecurities. In fact, I can’t think of one person who does’t still have some
        insecurities. I am no exception - for me it’s always been my intelligence. It wasn’t until recently I started
        having more of an appreciation for my capability and actually gained confidence. I still have a ways to go, but
        don’t we all!</p>
      <p>That being said, I want to share some techniques I picked up along the way which I have found beneficial,
        perhaps they will help you too.</p>
      <div class="full-width-text">
        <br>
        <p><strong>Surround Yourself</strong></p>
        <p>No matter your insecurities, a supportive network is key. Surround yourself with people you admire and who
          inspire you. Surround yourself with supportive and trustworthy people. Surround yourself with people who will
          challenge you to grow. It is in this environment you will shine, gain confidence, and have this confidence
          integrate into who you are as a being and be expressed through your action. As you move through your life,
          you should have continual reminders of your excellence, you should have experiences in which you learn and
          grow, and you should have experiences in which you help others. This can all be found and accomplished by
          surrounding yourself with the right people. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Continually Learn</strong></p>
        <p>In order to improve, become more comfortable with a topic, and gain confidence, you must learn and take
          action. Know it will not always be easy, but keep moving forward anyways. Think of this as your network for
          continual education.</p>
        <p>My network for continual learning includes listening to podcasts, reading books and writing, watching
          documentaries and movies, attend workshops and conferences, following inspirational blogs, and more. As you
          learn and gain knowledge, help yourself and help others - this is an incredible way to build confidence and
          share your greatness with the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Acknowledge The Past</strong></p>
        <p>Regardless of the challenges in your past, look for the silver linings. Even the smallest of benefit coming
          from the difficulty can drastically reshape your perception - reducing your insecurity and improving your
          confidence. This may seem odd at first, but like all things, it requires practice.</p>
        <p>As an example, in grade school I was often told I was unable to learn as quickly as other students my age. I
          was placed in several special education classes and always needed tutors. I hated every second of it. These
          circumstances imprinted into my perception of myself. Until recently (even after finishing college) I thought
          of myself as dumb. These past events were preventing me from overcoming this insecurity and thought process.
          It wasn’t until I realized everyone was trying to support me the best they could that I was able to move
          forward. With time I was able to part ways with this strong negative influences and embrace my capabilities.
          Once I had found my silver lining, it was much easier to continue building my confidence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The cultivation and integration of confidence does indeed take time - no doubt it can be daunting. Obstacles
          and challenges will shake the foundation you are building. But it’s never too late to start. It’s never too
          late to change. Try to have an appreciation for your current self and your accomplishments. You deserve
          honoring. You deserve respect. You deserve love.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> My writing is often highly reflective of my own experiences and information I have
          integrated into my lifestyle. In no way is my writing meant to be a blanket statement which applies to
          everyone. I highly encourage you to use the techniques that resonate with you, while leaving the rest.</p>
