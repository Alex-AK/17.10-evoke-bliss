      <p>What gives your life meaning? What adds value to your life? Is something holding you back? In what direction do you want to take your life? Answering questions like these allow you to progress towards happiness and health. But damn, they are difficult
        to think about.</p>
      <div class="full-width-text">
        <p>Answering difficult questions was never my forte. It still isn’t, but it’s been getting easier. My avoidance techniques used to be impeccable. I would load up on busy work or intentionally neglect work, school, and friends to play video games
          for days on end. I wasn’t proud of this habit, but it was all I knew. I’ve only recently begun to confront these difficult questions and situations. My technique? Time and attention. Difficult questions and situations require attention – this
          was the easy part for me. The harder part was, and still is, finding time with little to no distraction. Time where I can focus on uncovering options and answers I didn’t know existed.</p>
        <p>Life is so packed full of responsibilities and distractions. Stressed, busy, and anxious is the new norm. Most people don’t give themselves time to unwind, relax, and ponder their lives. When there’s no time to assess, life gets chaotic and stressful
          or lack-luster and stale. Seldom do we unconsciously end up with a satisfying life with just the right amount of work and play. Happiness and balance will not come by filling every second of every day with responsibilities, busy work, and distraction.</p>
        <p>It’s important to remember you have a choice in your schedule. If you are stressed or stuck, prioritize some time and attention to the questions in your life that need answering. </p>
        <p>My advice? Solitude. Alone time opens space in your life for answers to come.</p>
        <p>Having a regular meditation practice has been the biggest factor in helping me progress towards my version of health and happiness.</p>
        <p>During meditation, I often unintentionally ruminate on past relationships. Thoughts of unworthiness are my biggest challenge. Before meditating, I would have gone out of my way to numb these thoughts and the accompanying emotions. But now, I see
          this as a prime time for me to sort out some of my own shit. When these thoughts and emotions come up, I take notes. I write down the thought process leading to unworthiness. I write down relevant events occurring in my life which may be stirring
          up old memories. I analyze what might be causing these repeating thoughts and emotions. The process of uncovering why I feel certain emotions relating to aspects of my life has helped my mental and physical health tremendously.</p>
        <p>The thought of being unworthy used to cripple me from pursuing my interests. Fear of failure would halt my endeavor shortly after beginning. Uncovering the truth has changed this - I am not unworthy. I still have thoughts of unworthiness. I am
          still fearful of failure. But I no longer let my thoughts and emotions stop me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Create your own version of health and happiness.</p>
        <p class="indent">1. Find time.<br>2. Ponder life.</p>
        <p>
          <br>Are you interested in stirring up more creativity?
          <br>Are you trying to find a solution to a problem?
          <br>Trying to find a new path because you are sick of your work?
          <br>Want to reduce your stress and anxiety?
          <br>Want to break free from repetitive negative thought patterns?</p><br>
        <p>Inquiring about life is a necessity. Give yourself some space. The process of cultivating new opportunities in your life isn’t going to be easy and not all of your ideas will be game changers. However, I guarantee you will have plenty of options
          and answers to choose from after giving yourself some space to ponder. Progress is happiness.</p>
        <p>Experiment with different options until you find one that works for you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indent">• Meditate - I often write down thoughts and ideas that come up during meditation so I can go back after and expand on the ideas or get to the bottom of thoughts.
          <br>• Go for a walk or drive without your cellphone.
          <br>• Google your interests - search for topics you want to get involved in to get inspired. Use that inspiration to act.
          <br>• Read an article or book - I find reading about new topics to be a great way to get out of a rut. Write down your thoughts and ideas as you read. Return to your notes for inspiration.
          <br>• Journal - I use a journaling software app on my laptop to jot down my thoughts. This has been extremely beneficial for me. When I am down, I look at my journal and see how much I have progressed. This perspective is always motivating for
          me to get back into a better state of mind.
          <br>Designate an hour of no electronics before bed time and after you wake up.
          <br>• Cancel your cable subscription, Netflix, and/or your internet - sounds extreme, but this has helped me tremendously. I have much more time to focus on my priorities - friendships, writing, health, and happiness.</p>
        <p>Make sure you always have something to write down your thoughts (notebook and pen, laptop, or phone). You never know when game changing ideas or thoughts will come up. If you don’t write it down, you will likely forget.</p>
        <p>Start now – use some of your time to create a path to your version of health and happiness.</p>
