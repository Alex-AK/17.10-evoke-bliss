      <p>The other day I saw a time lapsed video of someone learning to dance over a full year. Each day they practiced their dance moves and recorded each session. Throughout the year they compiled a video time lapse of themselves dancing from day 1 to day 365. Talk about inspirational. She started with zero experience and ended up a pro. With each step showing drastic improvement.</p>

        <p>So, what's the key to mastering a skill? It's no secret. It just takes practice. But regardless of knowing how to get to the end goal, we often don’t. Here are four guidelines to help you progress towards your goals and master learning new skills. In other words, this is the practice of practice.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Practice</strong> - In order to improve at any skill you must actually take action towards improving the skill. As each 24 hour day passes by, only a small amount of time is needed to improve a skill. Want to learn to dance, sing, improve your reading and writing speeds, improve your health, or finally learn to meditate? Dedicate about 10 minutes each day for yourself to practice your skill. Make this a non-negotiable part of your day and watch the improvements roll in.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Practice with Consistency</strong> - In order to build a strong habit and get better at your skill, you must practice with consistency. Although this can sound daunting, the beauty of this is it only takes about 10 minutes. Consistent practice of about 10 minutes per day has been shown to be much more effective at learning a skill than practicing for longer periods of time with less frequency. Of course, you can dedicate more time to new skills if you want, but the most important component is consistency.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Practice with Intention</strong> - Learning any new habit can have it’s obstacles - be it physical, mental, or emotional. It’s common to run into resistance and a lack of interest when learning new skills. That’s why it’s important to remind yourself why you are practicing in the first place. Write a short note to yourself as to why you are learning the skill. Make sure you see the note each time you practice and take a moment to let the intention set in before beginning.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Practice with Efficiency</strong> - While practicing new skills it’s easy to burn out and lose motivation. This is very common, but can be avoided with some preparation. Take some time before embarking on a new journey to learn a bit about the skill. Find the most enjoyable and efficient way to ensure your progress moves quickly, while avoiding willpower exhaustion. What does this look like? Using yoga as an example, it would be highly beneficial to learn some of the main poses almost every teacher uses in their class (i.e. forward fold, downward dog, and the warrior poses.) This way no matter what class you are in or what sequence you are practicing, you will be familiar with the base poses.</p>
        <p>Follow these four guidelines above and practice your practice. Within no time you will be improving your skills and progressing towards your end goal; and don’t forget to enjoy the process of learning - it’s supposed to be enjoyable!</p>
        <p>So, now I ask you. What is something you’ve always wanted to learn but haven’t? Are you willing to challenge yourself to progress towards your goals?</p>
