      <p>In the moments of heavy emotions and family affairs, I find myself exhausted and resentful. Exhausted
        physically, mentally, emotionally. Resentful… why is this happening? I feel I am alone in this challenge.</p>
      <p>The truth though? I couldn't be more wrong. Everyone in this world has their own stories, their own tales.
        Tales of struggle and pain, joy and triumph - we all experience the same emotions. So, why do I feel alone in
        this? I still ponder this question. But, in sharing my story, perhaps I will feel less alone. Perhaps you will
        feel less alone.</p>
      <div class="full-width-text">
        <p>I'll never forget the moment three days after my mom’s surgery, in a Holiday Inn Express next to the
          freeway. August 1, 2014. I was offering support in the process of her recovery. The phone rang. A minute of
          silence, followed by a response. She sounded saddened, shocked, devastated. Possibly our worst fears - a
          diagnosis of cancer. Fear overtook me. Fear I would loose my mom. Fear she would never be a grandmother to my
          children.</p>
        <p>The last seven months have been some of the most challenging in my life. Physically challenging. I spend
          over half of my week being a caretaker. Driving to and from doctor’s appointments and treatments - hours upon
          hours in the car. More nights in hotel beds than my own. Mentally challenging. Thoughts of life and death -
          truths of this existence plague my mind. Thoughts of isolation. As if I'm the only person to struggle through
          difficult times like these. I wonder if I’m being selfish for thinking these thoughts and feeling these
          emotions; after all, I’m not the one with cancer. Emotionally challenged. Fear, guilt, anger, and sadness run
          rampant throughout my days. Interest, joy, and excitement pop up from time to time, mainly because I
          temporarily forget the circumstances. I cling to the moments I am happy, yet I feel guilty for this joy.</p>
        <p>In these moments, it's easy to forget, but imperative for my health - I must know I am not alone. I must
          know my mom is not alone. Friends, family, loved ones, acquaintances, strangers, all know pain, loss, guilt,
          anger, and fear. We are all in this life together experiencing the same emotions and struggles. Variation in
          our stories; variation in the details - the truth is, we are not alone. Difficult times don’t have to bring
          isolation. Often times all we need to feel supported is a listening ear or a helping hand. Each one of us has
          support; more often than not we just need to ask for it.</p>
        <p>It's weirdly comforting seeing statistics like one in three people will get cancer in their lifetime. How
          can I be alone with data like this? It seems everyone can relate to my story, and I to many of yours. This is
          not a tale of woes however. For within struggle there is beauty, an opportunity for change - benefit coming
          directly from the struggle.</p>
        <p>In my story, there have been miraculous improvements in the quality of life from what is commonly a life
          shattering diagnosis. Of course, my story is still unfolding, like many of yours. For my mother and those who
          are close to her, there have been many benefits - shifts towards living in the present moment, observing all
          that is precious and beautiful in this life, an appreciation for the time shared. It has impacted my life
          more than I can comprehend, each day unfolding something that would not have occurred without this diversion.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was a child, I have had difficult health challenges. When I was seventeen, fresh out of high
          school, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. I put in little effort to actually better my health, often, just
          putting in enough to function somewhat normally. It wasn't until the day my mom was diagnosed things really
          changed for me. My definition of living changed drastically. Ever since, I have been working hard towards
          bettering my health. Falling down along the way, only to pick myself back up again, with more determination
          than ever. Going through a myriad of emotions and thoughts of hopelessness. From that moment on, my beliefs
          began to shift. My perspectives began to shift. My actions began to shift. After the tears, and a terrible
          night’s sleep, something clicked for me: I must prioritize myself. For if I don’t take care of my health, who
          will?</p>
        <p>I pulled out my phone and wrote the following:</p>
        <p>All I can do is be the best me I can be, so I can support her and help in any way she needs. If I am strong,
          she has to be strong with me.</p>
        <p>To this day, I try to live by this belief. I find, the more I take care of myself, the more my mom is
          inspired to take care of herself, a nice benefit. The more I take care of myself, the better I am able to
          support others. My mom’s diagnosis jolted my priorities. Through this experience, I have fully realized, I am
          solely responsible for my health and wellbeing. With a newfound focus on my health and happiness I will
          continue to stabilize my emotional, mental, and physical health regardless of circumstance.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the most difficult times of life, it’s important to remember these challenges give us an
          opportunity to better ourselves. An opportunity to shift priorities towards what is truly important in life,
          whatever that means for you. The time we have is precious and finite. I encourage you, no matter how scary
          and difficult it may be, to find what brings meaning to your life. This might mean redefining your values and
          restructuring your lifestyle. There’s no doubt, there will be challenge, but don’t let these challenges
          cripple you from living the life you want. Be courageous in the face of fear - feel the fear, and act
          anyways. </p>
        <p>It took something big to slow my mom down, to shift her noble pursuit of helping others towards helping
          herself. It took something big to get me to make a shift, to take on more responsibility for my own health
          than ever before. Both my mom and myself needed a paramount event to catapult our lives into prioritizing
          ourselves. The good news is my mom has had major improvements in her health and life, often feeling better
          than she has felt in years. She is now following her passions, no longer letting her busy and stressful work
          schedule dominate her life. She is now prioritizing herself - for this I am extremely grateful.</p>
        <p>As for me, my health is better than it has ever been. I am able to take care of myself, and help my mom far
          more than I would have been capable prior to this shift. I have started writing, a path I have long been
          scared of pursuing. I have started sharing my journey, another terrifying endeavor, in hopes it will in some
          way support you through yours. I will continue doing so, helping you in any way I can, but only after taking
          care of myself, of course.</p>
