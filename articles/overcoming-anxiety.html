    <h2>Overcoming Anxiety in an Anxious World</h2>

      <p>Likely everyone you meet will have some degree of anxiety. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix. It has likely taken time for this anxiousness to build up within your life and will take some time to undo. It’s important to note overcoming anxiety is a process; it will take time and effort. With each choice you make, you can shift towards eliminating excess anxiousness, worry, discomfort, nervousness, and stress.</p>

      <div class="full-width-text">
        <p>The following guidelines have worked well for me in my process of overcoming anxiety. No doubt, from time to time, I still have mild anxiety, but this is not a bad thing. The anxiety I encounter now is significantly reduced and doesn’t prevent me from taking action, living my life, or promote a harmful amount of stress. In fact, the anxiety I feel now often reminds me I am pursuing something meaningful.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Identify The Cause</strong></p>
        <p>Identifying the cause of anxiety is the first step in overcoming the feeling.</p>
        <p>The source of my anxiety was and still is thinking I am not good enough - most people can relate to this since we are constantly compared to others and graded based on our performance. Clinical psychologist Tara Branch says, "Different people respond to the sense of unworthiness in different ways. Some might stay busy, trying to prove themselves valuable; others, fearful of failure, may become discouraged or even paralyzed. Still others may resort to addictive behaviors to avoid facing their shame and fear.”</p>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, I have felt inferior to everyone else, which has resulted in all three of the above coping mechanisms. I tried to prove my worth by finishing college, even though I didn’t enjoy it. I've spent months cooped up in my house avoiding taking action so I wouldn’t risk failing. And I spent a huge chunk of my life addicted to video games trying to avoid living or experiencing any negative emotions. I saw everyone else as “having it together,” thinking I was the only one who had no idea what I was doing in my life. The reality is this is much more common than I ever imagined. Most of us struggle with anxiety, and it’s our responsibility to take back control.</p>
        <p>You may or may not relate to this - the important part is to get a sense of the root cause of your anxiety, from there you can reduce it’s grip.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Change Your Perception</strong></p>
        <p>Growing up, we are exposed to many different beliefs through our experiences, our parents, and our peers. These beliefs may or may not have been consciously chosen - but more often than not, we carry some beliefs which are harmful.</p>
        <p>Perception of any event, story, or person, including oneself, depends on the beliefs we choose to accept. Again, sometimes these beliefs were chosen unconsciously; i.e. if we were picked on in school, we might adopt a sense of unworthiness. Holding this unconscious belief of unworthiness may induce an overwhelming amount of anxiety which builds over time.</p>
        <p>The fact is, we choose our beliefs. Always. We can change them anytime we want; although some beliefs are easier to change than others.</p>
        <p>Given a choice, would you rather believe you have a large potential to be successful, or that you aren’t capable or worthy of reaching your goals? Seems obvious, yet, a lot of us go through life with these unbeneficial, limiting, and harmful beliefs. Author Mark Manson says, “A lot of times our problems are not actually problems, but rather symptoms of our unhelpful beliefs.”</p>
        <p>So, is anxiety coming from a belief of unworthiness or a perception of failure being so devastating or risky it’s not worth taking action. It could be both. We all have our own experiences and hardships through life and it is worth learning from our mistakes. However, it doesn’t seem beneficial to continue believing we are unworthy or that fear or failure will kill us.</p>
        <p>It’s not easy, but we can choose in each moment to reinforce beneficial beliefs. So why not choose to believe we are worthy of success. Why not choose to believe that we can accomplish anything. Why not choose to believe failure won’t kill us, but instead teach us what to do better next time.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Breathe</strong></p>
        <p>In acute occurrences of anxiety, nervousness, or overwhelm, it can be extremely beneficial to take a few moments to consciously take a few breaths. I recommend placing a hand on the stomach, take a slow inhale through the nose and expand the belly outward, followed by a slow exhale through the nose while pulling the belly inward. Continue this process for a few breaths or until the anxiety passes.  </p>
        <p>"Belly breath" is the simplest approach to slowing down the body and mind so the anxiousness is less overwhelming in the moment. This breathing practice engages the parasympathetic nervous system, which shifts the body and mind into a state of relaxation.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Meditate</strong></p>
        <p>Having a regular meditation practice of 10-20 minutes per morning has greatly reduced my anxiety and overall nervousness. I highly recommend a morning meditation if you experience any sort of overwhelm from stress or anxiety in your life.</p>
        <p>Regular meditation creates clarity and flexibility in the mind. Mental flexibility gives a strong foundation for facing difficulties and stressors throughout the day.</p>
        <p>The practice of meditation itself used to stir up huge amounts of anxiety for me - I would often have panic attacks after even a minute of meditation; my heart would start to race, pressure would build up in my chest, and my breath would speed up. A common, and understandably so, perception of this occurring is a failure to meditate. Although not everyone experiences this, this process is normal in the beginning. This sensation passes with a few attempts at meditation, and is often diminished at the realization that you are and never were in any danger. If you are worried about this happening, practice an eyes open meditation. </p>
        <p><br><strong>Minimize</strong></p>
        <p>Over the last several months I have gotten rid of 80% of my material possessions and canceled the services I no longer wanted to pay for like Internet, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. Although I loved having these services, I didn’t love being responsible for paying the bill each month. This isn’t the route you have to go, but it is an option for drastically reducing stress and anxiety around the topic of finances. Minimizing your life in the slightest will mean you are responsible for one less bill. One less bill might save you two hours a week, giving you more time to pursue your interests.</p>
        <p>Apart from money, minimalism has its benefits. My closet used to be full of clothes I didn’t wear. I had over twenty-five of the same long sleeve button-up shirt in different colors and patterns, eleven pairs of shoes, and eight pairs of pants. Every morning as I picked out my outfit, anxiety crept in. Being able to step back and observe this process was eye opening. Post-transition to minimalism, I have six long sleeve shirts, six plain t-shirts, two pairs of shoes (casual and dress), and three pairs of pants. I no longer get anxious over the trivial endeavor of putting an outfit together. Leaving the house is a breeze.</p>
        <p>Finances and wardrobe are just some examples of the potential behind minimalism. I invite you to ask yourself “where can I minimize to eliminate some unneeded anxiety?"</p>
        <br><p>So, there it is. My steps for overcoming anxiety.</p>
        <p>I recommend starting by trying to uncover your source of anxiety. Once uncovered, try to find value and benefit in your experiences. Identify and write down new beneficial beliefs around relationships, self, self-worth, work, goals, etc. Keep reminding yourself of these beliefs you want to incorporate. Take a few breaths. Try meditation. Try getting rid of excess stress, bills, or possessions that may be causing unnecessary overwhelm.</p>
