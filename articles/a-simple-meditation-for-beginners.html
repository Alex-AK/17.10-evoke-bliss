    <h2>A Simple Meditation for Beginners</h2>

      <p>I have talked with countless people who struggle to meditate. The idea that meditation has to be hours on end
        sitting in a cave is unrealistic for most. Here is a simple meditation you can practice anywhere at anytime. No
        prior experience for
        this meditation is required. Take note of how you feel before and after the practice. I encourage you to write
        down your experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> Find a comfortable seat and close your eyes.</p>
        <p class="indent">-Options: a chair (feet on floor), or a cushion or yoga block on the floor (in cross legged
          position).<br> -Arms should be resting on thighs or knees.<br> -Having your back against a wall allows you to
          maintain physical alignment with ease.</p>
        <p> <strong>2.</strong> Lengthen the spine, bring the top of the head towards the ceiling. <br> <strong>3.</strong>
          Relax the shoulders downward and slightly back. <br> <strong>4.</strong> Place a hand on the belly. <br>
          <strong>5.</strong> Slowly inhale through the nose into the belly region (belly expands outward.)</p>
        <p class="indent">-Inhale should be about 4 seconds.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Slowly exhale through the nose. Pull the belly inward slightly with the exhale.</p>
        <p class="indent">-Exhale should be about 6 seconds.</p>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> Continue this practice for as long as you would like.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you find yourself mentally adding items to your grocery list, shift your attention
        back to your breath.</p>
      <p> That’s it. Meditation doesn’t have to be complicated. It doesn’t have to be difficult. Practice this for a
        few minutes per day or when you are stressed. With time, you will notice a difference.</p>
