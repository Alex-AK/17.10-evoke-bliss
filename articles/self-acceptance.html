    <h2>Self-Acceptance In A Nutshell</h2>

      <p>Self-acceptance is an important part of being healthy and happy. But what does this actually look like?</p>
      <p>I believe self-acceptance does not mean accepting everything about yourself as you are, but instead accepting
        what you can’t change and taking action towards improving what you can. By accepting what can’t be changed and
        taking action on what can, the potential for self-improvement drastically increases.</p>
      <div class="full-width-text">
        <p>In my mind, we, as individuals, underestimate our power and ability to change. We can improve our physical
          body with activities like healthy eating and exercise. We can improve our mental and emotional stability with
          activities like meditation, writing, and reading. And we can quickly progress towards our goals by modifying
          habits and updating beliefs about what is possible. However, these topics are only attainable and sustainable
          when we believe in ourselves; self-doubt offers little benefit.</p>
        <p>So, what cannot be changed? Well, this is for you to decide. I recommend writing a list to help clarify your
          current beliefs; noting we tend to carry a lot of limiting beliefs about what can and cannot be changed.
          While uncovering what can’t be changed, I advise not discrediting past experiences and choices. Your past has
          shaped you into exactly who you are in this moment and little benefit comes from shaming oneself. Once
          uncovering what can’t be changed, you have the option of focusing more attention on what can be changed -
          this is the fun part.</p>
        <p>In Colin Wright’s book Considerations he states, “Rather than discounting yourself as a lost cause and
          wanting to be someone else, the trick is recognizing yourself as an excellent foundation upon which to build
          whatever you want.”</p>
        <p>Colin further provides the following questions, which may be helpful in your journey, as they have been in
          mine.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indent"> • If you want to change, and you know what you want to change, why haven’t you?
          <br>• What actions have you taken today to get closer to realizing your goals?
          <br>• What’s standing in the way of you getting there faster?
          <br>• What are you willing to give up in order to become a better version of yourself?
        </p>
        <p>So there it is, my current version of self-acceptance in a nutshell. Uncover what you can and cannot change.
          Use your base - who you are in this moment - and build upon it. Take action on what can be changed - strive
          to be a better version of yourself. Use others as a source of inspiration but don't try to be someone else.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> While I encourage self-acceptance and personal development through my writing, the
          last thing I want to do is pressure or guilt you into changing. I offer a look into my belief systems as a
          source of inspiration to take action. Please incorporate what resonates with you and leave the rest.</p>
